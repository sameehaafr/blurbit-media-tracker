5. Form auto-fills with media information

- **Movies:** OMDB API (IMDB data)
- **Podcasts:** Spotify Web API

## üß™ Testing

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test each media type:**
   - **Books:** Search for "Harry Potter" or "1984"
   - **Movies:** Search for "Inception" or "The Matrix"
   - **Podcasts:** Search for "Serial" or "This American Life"

3. **Check the debug info** (bottom-right corner) to see API status

## üîí Security Notes

- API keys are stored in environment variables
- Client-side keys are prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
- Server-side keys (like Spotify secret) are kept private
- All API calls include proper error handling

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Books not working:
- Check internet connection
- Google Books API is usually very reliable

### Movies not working:
- Verify OMDB API key is correct
- Check if you've exceeded the free tier limit
- Try the demo key: `demo`

### Podcasts not working:
- Verify Spotify credentials
- Check if the app is properly configured
- Ensure client secret is not exposed in client-side code

## üéâ Ready to Use!

Once you've set up the APIs you want to use, the media search will work seamlessly with your existing Supabase setup. Users can now search and select media instead of manually typing everything!
